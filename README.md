HackMobile
==========

Inventory your fridge. Connect friends. Learn to cook. Win hackathons


Core Functionality (2 People)
-----------------------------

- Build the system that takes the picture and processes it into the database (will involve compression, and hashing and/or [pixel color distribution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/843972/image-comparison-fast-algorithm))
- Implement search algorithm to find items taken out of the fridge matching old ones (present a few results, highlighting the best one, and allow users to select or scroll through other close ones for the correct image)
- May also need database of common items to match photos to actual objects, see below
- This is a hack, we can just use a few common demo items and photos and make sure it works for them. Ideally would be fully automatic (motion sensor for taking photo) but doesn't have to be for hackathon!

Social Connection and Education (1-2 People)
----------------------------

- Share with friends what's in your fridge, update when you have compatible items (you have chips? I have salsa, let's eat!)
- See if ingredients with or without friends match recipes, and teach them to cook the recipe
